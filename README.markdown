This is a chess bot I wrote in order to play with bitboards and alpha-beta
search. It wasn't worth naming it, so I didn't. It's slow, buggy, and doesn't
play chess very well, but was a ton of fun to write.

This progam should be considered neither a good example of how to write a
decent chess bot, nor a good example of C style. It is neither. I am
(slowly) cleaning up the code and fixing bugs, but there are still plenty
of issues on both fronts.
