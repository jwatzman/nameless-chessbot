- do I need to if (target) -- should be redundant
- is the table zeroed?
- split out "best move" table from "header" table etc?
- eviction policy -- "used" count?
- compare against http://mediocrechess.blogspot.com/2007/01/guide-perft-scores.html

- why is perft so slow???
	- explicitly setting/unsetting bits, instead of xor, might help;
	  will prob require splitting do/undo common
		- nope: https://gist.github.com/jwatzman/e6853976d46eb9eb35e4440f737c9508
	- stockfish: undo data is kept in a separate struct, instead of in the
	  board -- saves undo ring buffer
	- stockfish: undo move is simple, why is mine complicated
	- stockfish: how does it deal with 3 repitition, can i save that buffer
	- can i remove/reduce zobrist_castle?
	- improve branch prediction
		- manual hints in movegen?
		- pgo?
