- transposition table
	- does zeroing the table matter? i don't think so?
	- eviction policy: move to two-buckets, one always-replace, one current algo http://mediocrechess.sourceforge.net/guides/transpositiontables.html
	- improve replacement algo -- don't replace deep search from 1 generation ago with shallow search now
	- move tt size to an exponent so always power of two
	- try to make it smaller
		- store alpha/beta/exact flag in top bits of Move?
		- can i make Move smaller? capture/castle/enpassant can be two bits total, don't need promotion bit
	- weirdness around killer moves -- try killer changes again after tweaking tt
		- only store noncaptures in killers -- most people do this, why is it such a loss for us
		- or, order capture killer before captures before killer before rest
- improve timer
	- move to setitimer(TIMER_REAL) [macOS does not have timer_create]
		- track "expected end" and re-set timer if we haven't hit it yet (so time can be increased during search)
		- or just check the time every N nodes searched -- removes unix-ixm
	- allows time to be increased, e.g., if hit aspiration failure
	- allows computing remaining time, e.g., if about to start another ply but there's very little time left
		- assume next ply will take AT LEAST twice current spent
	- do something with fixed time, e.g., in 2+1 we just use the 1 right now!
- pondering
	- maybe straightforward with pthreads and manually forcing a timeup?
	- always move search into a thread so it can be interrupted?
	- need to be careful of atomic access / memory barriers
- move ordering
	- SEE
		- http://mediocrechess.sourceforge.net/guides/see.html
	- can we do any ordering on non-captures?
		- history heuristic http://mediocrechess.sourceforge.net/guides/killermoveshistoryheuristic.html
		- there's something where you make sure you aren't moving a queen to be attacked by a pawn (generally, lower-value piece)
